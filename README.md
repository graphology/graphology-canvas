# Graphology Canvas

Canvas rendering routines for [`graphology`](https://graphology.github.io).

## Installation

```
npm install graphology-canvas

Note that `graphology-canvas` relies on [`node-canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas). As such, if you experience issues when installing the libray check that you have the required dependencies as listed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas#compiling).
